# Event Sourcery PHP CQRS / ES Library #

The Event Sourcing / CQRS framework whose core principle is keeping it simple.

# Components #

## Values ##

Values represent things like names, temperature, ids, etc. Anything that uses value semantics derives from the following classes.

> Value semantics: equality is determined by comparing value, not ID. 

1. SerializableValue
2. SerializablePersonalDetails

## Entities ##

Entities are objects that are represented with identifier equality. Two objects are equal if they have the same ID. If the values of two objects are identical however they have different IDs then they will not compare as equal. If the values are completely different but they share the same ID then they will compare as equal.

### Entity IDs ###

Identification is the process of determining one entity from others. In this framework, IDs are subclasses of one of the following classes:

1. Id
2. StreamId

The `Id` class exists to provide a basic Id implementation.

The `StreamId` class is a subclass as `Id`. It exists to differentiate stream IDs from any other kind of ID. Essentially, it only exists to make the code more expressive / easier to understand.

## Aggregates ##

Aggregates are singleton processes. Functionally only one can exist at a time. This is accomplished through ensuring that every aggregate update is given a sequence number and by using RDBMS transactions to prevent multiple processes from making a change to an aggregate at the same time.

The singleton nature of an aggregate allows for immediate consistency. Updates made to the aggregate (assuming no business rules were violated and the transactionality is upheld) can be immediately confirmed.

Aggregates provide public methods that trigger state changes. These public methods will guard business rules using internal state and then will update the aggregate by raising new events. The internal state that is used to guard business rules generally comes from events that have already occurred within that aggregate. Whenever an event occurs within an aggregate, its local state is updated, and that local state will be used for guarding future business rules.

## Domain Events ##

Domain events implement the `DomainEvent` interface. The interface is empty of public fields. It is used only as a marker to discriminate domain events. 

All fields within a domain event are public and they must all extend one of the `SerializableValue` classes.
